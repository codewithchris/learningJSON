As a result, the framework automatically performs most of the work traditionally done by view controllers.</p><p>The framework provides tools, like state variables and bindings, for connecting your app's data to the user interface.

Apply a property wrapper by adding an attribute with the wrapper's name to a property's declaration. The property gains the behavior specified by the wrapper. The state and data flow property wrappers in SwiftUI watch for changes in your data, and automatically update affected views as needed. When you refer directly to the property in your code, you access the wrapped value. Alternatively, you can access a property wrapper's projected value by prefixing the property name with the dollar sign ($). SwiftUI state and data flow property wrappers always project a Binding, which is a two-way connection to the wrapped value, allowing another view to access and mutate a single source of truth.</p>"
